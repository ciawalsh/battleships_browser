# Playing Battleships in the browser

### Makers Academy Week 3 Project

The game is ready to play when theres are two players initialized with a board each and each board has 5 ships placed. 

By default it is player1's go first and after each shot it will switch the turns until there is a winner. 

A game_setup.rb file has been added which sets up the game to a ready state placeing each ship from colums A through to E vertically. 

In this project we will be implementing the game in the browser
